README

Requirements:
    - Node Package Manager (npm)

Clone Repository and run the following for development:

chmod +x npm-fast-install.sh
./npm-fast-install.sh

(despite the name of this script, it is not particularly fast, so go grab some coffee and come back)

Once complete, run 'gulp' in a terminal window to stand up the server on localhost and launch the website with Browser-Sync. This will run a watch that should be constantly running in the background for the duration of development.
